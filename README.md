# Salary-Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict individuals' salaries based on their demographics, including factors such as occupation, age, gender, experience, education, and more. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 32,561 rows and 15 columns. It includes 8 independent variables and 1 target variable, which is the salary. The data covers a diverse range of countries and races, providing a broad basis for analysis.


The dataset includes a thorough compilation of demographic and salary data along with extra information on years of experience. It provides a useful tool for researching the connections between different sociodemographic characteristics and income. The demographic characteristics offer a wide range of factors for examination, including age, gender, education, country, and race. Scholars have the ability to investigate patterns and trends in the distribution of income among distinct demographic groups, which can provide valuable insights into any discrepancies or differences in earning potential. Additionally, the dataset includes the important factor of years of experience, which allows for studies into how professional tenure affects pay scales. This feature gives the analysis a dynamic element and allows researchers to look at how income varies depending on both acquired work experience and demographic traits.
